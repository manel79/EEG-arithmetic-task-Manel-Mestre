Analysis of EEG Patterns During Mental Arithmetic Task

Author: Manel Mestre Bentanachs

Project Overview
This project analyzes EEG patterns observed during mental arithmetic tasks. The analysis is divided into two parts, each covered by a separate R Markdown (.RMD) file.

Contents
Statistics.RMD: Statistical analysis of EEG data to identify patterns during arithmetic tasks.
Machine Learning.RMD: Application of 15 different machine learning classification algorithms to evaluate which classifier performs best with the EEG data.
data/: Directory containing the raw data files.
Results/: Directory containing formatted result files for better understanding.

Usage
Data Preparation:

Ensure the raw data files are placed in the data directory.
Ensure the subject file is in the correct format and location as required by the scripts.

Running the Analysis:

Execute the .RMD files using an R-compatible environment.
The scripts will read the raw data from the data directory and the subject file.

Output:

The scripts will generate Excel files in the main folder.
Manually formatted versions of these files can be found in the Results directory.

Results
The Results folder contains the output files manually formatted for better understanding and interpretation.
